                        finTrack is a minimal yet powerful expense tracking app developed as a hobby project by a Master's student in High Integrity Systems and a Software Engineer with nearly 2 years of industry experience. It was born out of a personal need for a clean, free alternative to manually managing finances in Excel, something that was both lightweight and genuinely useful for everyday financial tracking. <br />
                        The app is designed to offer a smooth and intuitive experience for users who want to take control of their spending without the complexity or cost of traditional budgeting software. Whether you're a student, a professional, or just someone looking to organize personal finances, finTrack aims to be your go-to tool for tracking expenses, understanding your savings, and making better financial decisions.
